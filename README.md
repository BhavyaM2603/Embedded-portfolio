# 🛠️ Embedded Systems Project Portfolio

Welcome to my embedded systems portfolio!  
This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects I've developed using platforms like **ESP32**, **nRF24L01**, and **Mbed OS**, with a focus on **real-time communication**, **sensor data handling**, and **firmware development**.

Each project demonstrates my understanding of microcontroller programming, protocol integration (UART, SPI, LoRa), and embedded design logic — both in hardware and simulation.

## 🔗 Projects

### ESP32-LoRa microwave sensor node
- Built a microwave sensor node using ESP32 and LoRa to study signal attenuation in various water conditions.
- Integrated a custom microwave sensor and fabricated a directional coupler to match LoRa frequency.
- Analyzed signal strength via RSSI and plotted calibration curves in MATLAB. Capstone project.


### MIMO-Communication Arduino + nRF
- Simulated a basic MIMO-like communication system using dual nRF24L01 transceivers and Arduino UNO.
- Implemented multi-channel wireless transmission via SPI protocol.
- Verified data reliability through signal strength testing and range experiments.


### MbedOS-Indoor-Monitoring
- Developed an indoor environment monitoring system using Mbed OS threads and GPIO-based alert logic.
- Simulated sensor polling (temperature, humidity, air quality) and exported data via UART.
- Visualized trends in MATLAB using CSV logs to detect threshold crossings.
